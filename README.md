# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++.

## Overview

This program allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe against each other in the console. Players take turns entering the row and column numbers to place their respective symbols ('x' or 'o') on the game board. The game continues until one player wins by getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or until the board is filled without a winner (resulting in a draw).

## Features

- Players can input their moves by entering row and column numbers.
- The game board is displayed after each move, showing the current state of the game.
- The program checks for a winner after each move and ends the game when a player wins or when there is a draw.

## Usage

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++): " g++ tic_tac_toe.cpp -o tic_tac_toe "
2. Run the compiled executable:  " ./tic_tac_toe "
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. Enter row and column numbers to place your symbol ('x' or 'o') on the game board.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler
- Standard C++ libraries
